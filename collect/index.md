## Collected presentations and papers

### Xenomai User Meeting 2009

`E.TISSERANT "Beremiz Roadmap from CanFestival and MatPLC to Automforge.net"`

**Abstract:**

_The Beremiz PLC programming environment originally involved developers of the
CanFestival free CANopen stack and MatPLC projects. The project has been
initiated in order to fill the gap between free software and control
engineering._

_Today, thanks to Beremiz, automation users can easily connect IEC-61131 function
blocks across CANopen networks with Free Software. Industrials, teachers,
students and researchers use that GPL project, and actively contribute with new
features every day._

_But what about the PLC programs they produce? Could PLC programming also benefit
from the Free Software ideology? A new Free Software Forge is to be held:
Automforge.net._

_In this presentation, are presented project's passed, present and future
milestones._

### IEEE INDIN 2007

`L.BESSARD, M.SOUSA, E.TISSERANT "An Open Source IEC 61131-3 Integrated Development Environment"`

A paper about Beremiz, going into some technical details on the compiler, and PLCopen editor.

**Abstract:**

_The IEC 61131-3 standard defines a common
framework for programming PLCs (Programmable Logic
Controllers), which includes the complete definition of four
programming languages and a state machine definition
language. Industrial PLC vendors are slowly offering support
for this standard, however small inconsistencies remain
between their implementations, transferring programs
between vendors is almost impossible due to different file
formats, and licenses are generally too expensive to allow
students do install these commercial solutions on their own
computers._

_To this end, the authors have developed an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) for the IEC 61131-3
framework, which is being offered to the general public under
the GNU Public License (GPL). The IDE consists of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a backend compiler.
Using the GUI the user may develop programs in any of the
four programming languages, as well as the state machine
definition language. The backend compiler is used to convert
these programs into equivalent C++ programs which may
later be compiled and executed on various platforms._

### International CAN Conference 2008

`E.TISSERANT, L.BESSARD "Automated CanOpen PDO mapping of IEC 61131-3 Directly Represented Variables"`

**Abstract:**

_CiA DS-405 defines a way to publish variables of IEC 61131-3 programmables
CANOpen nodes through their Object Dictionary, using Dynamic Index Assignment
defined in DS-302. Correspondence between IEC 61131-3 variables and Object
Dictionary entries is let to the responsibility of the PLC manufacturer._

_IEC 61131-3 defines some Directly Represented Variables, specifying direction, size,
and location of physical variables. In this representation, location is an arbitrary count
of integers separated by dots. Again, correspondence between location of IEC 61131-3
and physical variables is manufacturer-specified._

_As a consequence, and despite of the standardization efforts of PLCopen and CiA,
there is still no real interchangeability of PLC nodes in a CANopen network.
This paper proposes a method for the PLC application writer to explicitly publish
and subscribe to CanOpen remote variables with Directly Represented Variables
location. As a complement to DS-405, it could suppress most network reconfiguration
steps when moving PLC programs from one brand to another._

_Presented concepts and algorithms are already implemented in the Beremiz and
CanFestival open source projects, and are publicly available._

## Collected demonstrations

### Open Software Platform for Automation (2012)

Under a government-funded project, [SSLab](http://ssl.uos.ac.kr) and [RTES lab](http://rtes.uos.ac.kr) are cooperating with mechanical industry to enable an open software platform for automation:

![](beremiz-eslab.png)

- "Synchronous control drive for the multi axial drive and the high power
servo-motor" project funded by MKE, Korea

- PC-based automation system using EtherCAT, an industrial real-time
Ethernet standard.

- Open source software incl. Linux/Xenomai, Beremiz, and Etherlab EtherCAT
master.

- Comformance with international standard: IEC 61131-3, CiA302, CiA402,
and IEC 61158.

- HTML5-based vector-graphics human interface.

- Wireless HMI

- Incorporation of computer vision (OpenCV) in automation.

Video shows the demonstration of SmartCart, an electric cart that
has been developed using Beremiz for performance evaluation. It is equipped
with two Maxon drives controlled via CANopen interface. Users are able to steer
the cart using gyro in his Android phone.

### Free Software for Six Degrees Of Freedom motion (2009)

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pA9w0MKpbC8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA9w0MKpbC8)

This video present a free software based machine made in collaboration with FESTO for LAAS.

LAAS is a French Scientific Research Lab involved in many scientific areas, mostly related computer and robotics.

For some computer vision experiments, this lab needed a positioning machine able to work within one cubic meter space with 6 degrees of freedom, and with 20ms time accuracy.

Motion control software had to be fully open so that researchers could have full control over positioning.

Realization involved six CANopen servo drives, and one industrial PC acting as a CANopen CNC, running real-time Linux, CanFestival and Beremiz.

As an input device for manual control mode, we used a wiimote.

### The Open Source Coffee Machine (2008)

The Open Source Coffee Machine is a recycled coffee machine, controlled
by a PC running Beremiz, and using some MicroMod CANopen I/O nodes from
Peak-System. This machine have been prepared in collaboration with Peak-System
for SCS-Paris-08 exhibition. It served Free coffees during 4 days on
Peak-System's booth and have been donated to IUT of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges
so that students can have fun practising automation.

### From Smarteh

This
[user manual](LpcManager_UserManual.pdf)

relevant information on how to use Beremiz in general.

### From LOLITECH

The
[manual](beremiz_user_manual_lolitech.pdf)
