## Free software for Automation

Beremiz is an integrated development environment for machine automation. It is 
[Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), conforming to
[IEC-61131](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3) among other standards.

It relies on open standards to be independent of the targeted device, 
and let you turn any processor into a PLC.
Beremiz includes tools to create HMI, 
and to connect your PLC programs to existing supervisions, databases, or fieldbuses.

With Beremiz, you conform to standards,
avoid vendor lock, and contribute to the better future of Automation.

## Motivations

Despite of open standards such as IEC 61131, PLCOpen and CanOpen,
control engineers cannot deploy results of their engineering effort
in an heterogeneous environment. It is usually required to rewrite 
your PLC program for each particular PLC brand.

The reason for this is that proprietary solutions providers do not 
fully conform to standards, thus preventing interoperability,
harmful to their business model.

Furthermore, standards specification are necessarily non exhaustive
and leave some "manufacturer specific" freedom to the implementer.
Solution providers make great benefits out of those manufacturer specific details,
at the expense of the freedom of the end user.

The Beremiz Project fills the gap between those independent standards specifications,
by providing an integrated reference implementation of them.
