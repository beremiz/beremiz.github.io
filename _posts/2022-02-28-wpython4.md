 |![](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/raw/master/demo/bitmaps/splash.png) | [wxPython](http://wxpython.org/) is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language. It allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that wrap the GUI components of the popular [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/) cross platform library, which is written in C++. |

As for python 2, wxPython 3.x is depricated. Supporting wxPython 4 is a necessary step in the migration to python 3.

## wxPython 4 together with wxPython 3

A [dedicated branch](https://github.com/beremiz/beremiz/tree/wxPython4) supports wxPython 4. That branch cannot merge with default branch, since many changes are incompatibles. Both branches will be maintained until WxPython 3 can be safely dropped.
